# Airbnb - Booking Web appp

Hey! 
I started this project from a YouTube video on how to make a simple crud app using the MERN stack. I added a lot of features after that.

- User authentication.
- Infinite Scroll and complex query.
- Third party services for image storage (cloudinary)
- Map view where you can see the nearby available places of yours.
- Booking the place.
- Typescript is used for better type safety.
